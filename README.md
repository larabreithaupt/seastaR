## Analyses

The analyses/ folder contains several scripts used for analyses in Hibbins et al. 2022. accuracy_ML_est.R tests the accuracy of the gene tree covariance matrix method using simulations and generated the results in Figure 4A. gt_error_ML_est.R tested the effects of gene tree estimation error on the covariance matrix method using simulations, and generated the results in Figure 5A. tomato_seastar_analysis.R uses seastaR to estimate evolutionary rates for empirical tomato floral traits, and generated the results in Figure 6A.
